*Algorithm Learning and Machine Learning AI Agents*
1. Reinforcement Learning: Use RL algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA) to optimize response generation.
2. Deep Learning: Use DL architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs) to improve multimodal fusion and response generation.
3. Transfer Learning: Use pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, ResNet) to leverage knowledge from other domains.
4. Meta-Learning: Use meta-learning algorithms (e.g., MAML, Reptile) to adapt to new tasks and domains.
